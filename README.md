# SQL_Project
Goal: The goal of writing this SQL program is to showcase my skills in database management, SQL query optimization, and data manipulation. By implementing various scenarios and optimizing tables and indexes, I demonstrate my proficiency in database design and performance tuning. The program also highlights my ability to analyze query runtimes, measure performance metrics, and generate visualizations for effective data presentation. Through this project, I aim to exhibit my problem-solving, analytical thinking, and programming skills, emphasizing my capability to enhance database performance and deliver efficient solutions in a professional setting.

Summary: The Python program presented employs various libraries, including sqlite3, matplotlib.pyplot, and numpy. It comprises functions that facilitate the modification of tables and indexes, execution of SQL queries, and management of database connections. The main function acts as the central component, orchestrating the execution of different scenarios, measuring query runtimes, and generating a graph to visualize the results. By utilizing the functions for table modifications and indexing, the program optimizes the database for different scenarios: uninformed, self-optimized, and user-optimized. This comprehensive approach ensures efficient data manipulation and retrieval, making the SQL queries more effective and enhancing overall database performance.

Specifics:
- The program begins by importing the necessary libraries and modules, including sqlite3, matplotlib.pyplot, and numpy.
- The program defines several functions: uninformed, self_optimized, user_optimized, drop_user_indices, query, connect, and disconnect.
- The uninformed function is responsible for setting the scenario to "Uninformed" and modifying the tables accordingly. It renames the tables, creates new tables with specific columns, and inserts data into the new tables. Finally, it commits the changes to the database.
- The self_optimized function sets the scenario to "self_optimized" and performs similar table modifications as the uninformed function but with additional primary and foreign key definitions. It also commits the changes to the database.
- The user_optimized function sets the scenario to "user_scenario" and performs the same table modifications as the self_optimized function. Additionally, it creates user-defined indices using the execute method of the cursor object. Finally, it commits the changes to the database.
- The drop_user_indices function drops the user-defined indices from the database using the execute method of the cursor object. It then commits the changes.
- The query function executes a SQL query on the database. It retrieves a random customer ID who has at least one order, and if such a customer exists, it returns the number of unique postal codes for the orders associated with that customer. Otherwise, it returns -1.
- The connect function takes a database path as input and returns a connection object and a cursor object.
- The disconnect function takes a connection object as input and closes the connection.
- The main function is the entry point of the program. It defines the scenarios, databases, and scenario_functions. It iterates over the databases and scenarios, connects to the database, executes the corresponding scenario function, measures the runtime of the query function, and records the average runtime. It also generates a graph using matplotlib.pyplot to visualize the results.
- The program ends with the execution of the main function.
